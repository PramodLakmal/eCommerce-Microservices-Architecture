🚀 eCommerce Microservices Architecture
This repository serves as the central hub for my scalable eCommerce application, built using .NET microservices architecture. It consolidates links to the three separate microservices, each designed with different architectural patterns and technologies to enhance scalability, maintainability, and performance.

🔗 Microservices Repositories
Each microservice is developed with a unique technology stack and database to optimize performance and scalability.

Architecture: Clean Architecture
Technologies: ASP.NET Core, Dapper, Fluent Validation
Database: PostgreSQL

Products Microservice :- https://github.com/PramodLakmal/eCommerceSolution.ProductsService

Architecture: Layered Architecture
Technologies: ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, Minimal APIs
Database: MySQL

Orders Microservice :- https://github.com/PramodLakmal/eCommerceSolution.OrdersService

Architecture: Event-Driven Architecture
Technologies: ASP.NET Core, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, Redis
